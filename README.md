This project is created using ReactJS, CSS & HTML. 

## Project Description
1. Provide the current weather summary for the given city.
2. Provide the forecast for the next 4 days. 

The intent to create this project was to learn more about React JS and CSS. 

Learnings: 
1. Creating functional components.
2. Passing of the props from parent to child.
3. Creating CSS. 
4. To understand more about the design, I created the design on Figma. Link for Figma will be shared soon.
5. Integrate API's to React.

PS: This is not responsive. Will be done shortly.
